## About Me
---

<img class="profile-picture" src="files/profile.jpg">

I'm a member of the embedded team at [Efficient Computer](https://www.efficient.computer/). I received my PhD in Computer Science and BS degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech in 2024 and 2019, respectively. My [dissertation](https://harriswms.github.io/files/Dissertation.pdf) explored circuit designs for power management in batteryless energy harvesting systems. As an undergrad, I built systems for detecting counterfeit recycled electronic devices based on aging mechanisms in SRAM (see the paper [here](https://harriswms.github.io/files/SiliconDatingArxiv.pdf)).

## Teaching
---

#### Principles of Computer Security (CS 4264 @ Virginia Tech)
##### Teaching Assistant - Fall 2019
This course teaches the security mindset and introduces the principles and practices of computer security as applied to software, host systems, and networks. It covers the foundations of building, using, and managing secure systems. Topics include standard cryptographic functions and protocols, threats and defenses for real-world systems, incident response, and computer forensics.
