## About Me
---

<img class="profile-picture" src="files/profile.png">

I am a Ph.D student at [CS@VT](https://cs.vt.edu/), advised by Dr. [Matthew Hicks](http://www.impedimenttoprogress.com/). I'm generally interested in computer architecture, embedded systems, and networking. My research is focused on hardware and software support for computation on energy harvesting devices: small, low-power systems using energy scavenged from the environment to sense, compute, and transmit data.

## Teaching
---

#### Principles of Computer Security (CS 4264 @ Virginia Tech)
##### Teaching Assistant - Fall 2019
This course teaches the security mindset and introduces the principles and practices of computer security as applied to software, host systems, and networks. It covers the foundations of building, using, and managing secure systems. Topics include standard cryptographic functions and protocols, threats and defenses for real-world systems, incident response, and computer forensics.

## Recognition
---

Davenport Leadership Scholarship (2022).

NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, Honorable Mention (2021).
